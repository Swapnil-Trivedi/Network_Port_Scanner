# Network_Port_Scanner
A simple Program to Find available Ports on a Target Server.

## INTRODUCTION

- A Network is incomplete without a port. Port and IP plays an important role in network communication in telling user where and to whom to send data.
For Example an IP address can be simplified as the House address of a family and the ports associated to that ip can be viewed as the rooms alloted to different members of that house. hence, it is crucial to check where the parcel needs to be sent and to whom.

- The Project is a small attempt to find the list of all open ports on a machine.
